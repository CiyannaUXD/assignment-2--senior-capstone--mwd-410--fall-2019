# Fall 2019 Senior Capstone — Assignment 2 (Project Scaffolding and Initial Database Design)

* **Do not edit this file.**  
* **Do not start this project until you have read these instructions carefully.**

## Introduction
In the next two-week sprint of your project, you and your team will co-ordinate an agreed-upon coding convention for HTML, Sass, and JavaScript. You will also build Gulp-based work flows for the development and production of your final project. And, lastly, you will construct, using JSON, the user persistent data you designed for the first assignment.

## Before You Begin
1. Log in to GitHub.
2. Fork this repo(sitory). See [this video](http://code-warrior.github.io/tutorials/git/github/forking-and-cloning-at-the-github-web-site/) on how to carry out this step and step `3`.
3. Clone your fork, using either the web site or the GitHub Desktop client.
4. Checkout your personalized branch, the one with your name and GitHub user handle.

## The Rules
### Repo Structure
The ownership and collaboration structure implemented for the first assignment will persist throughout this and all subsequent assignments. Thus, links to your assignments needn’t be submitted.
